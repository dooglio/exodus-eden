exodus-eden (1.47.0-pre-2) xenial; urgency=high

  * General: Added a visual indicator to hide/unhide your password when signing into your
    wallet. This helps users who like to see the password they are typing. Just
    be sure no one can see your screen if you use this!
  * Exchange: Ripio (RCN) has been added. You can now send, receive and exchange Ripio for
    other Exodus assets. As the official token of the Ripio Credit Network, RCN
    tokens are “required to access the network and facilitate transactions among
    all agents.” More information on the project and token can be found on
    Ripio’s Website.
  * Wallet: More entries have been added to our ever growing list of Ethereum Assets
    (also called ERC20 tokens for you tech-heads). Exodus now allows you to send
    and receive; Bread (BRD), Genesis Vision (GVT), Iconomi (ICN), KuCoin (KCS),
    MediShares (MDS), Pillar (PLR), Ripio (RCN), Rivetz (RVT), Santiment (SAN),
    Substratum (SUB), TenX (PAY), and Time New Bank (TNB).
  * Exodus now supports sending to Bech32 BTC addresses. This is a first step in
    our effort to add full SegWit support on Exodus for Bitcoin. For those that
    want to take a deep dive more info can be found on the Bitcoin Wiki.
  * CashAddr support for BCH has been added. No more pesky address conversion
    needed. 🙌
  * We lightened up LTC fees over 3X! They’ve been reduced from 0.0095 to 0.003
    per transaction.
  * Backup: We squashed some bugs in the wallet backup process to keep things smooth as
    silk - adding extra protection to keep your assets safe.
